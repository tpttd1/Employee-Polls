# Employee Polls Project

This is the source code for the final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course.

The web app let an employee create polls for coworkers. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.

Users will be able to answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

In the project directory, you can run:

# To setting local environment
### `npm install`

# To start local
### `npm start`

# To run test
### `npm test`

# To build source code
### `npm run build`
